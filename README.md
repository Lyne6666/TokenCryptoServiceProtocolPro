# TokenCryptoServiceProtocolPro

## Description

A privacy-focused cryptocurrency wallet leveraging zk-SNARKs for shielded transactions and a novel Merkle tree-based account model to enhance anonymity and reduce on-chain footprint.

## Features

- Implements a modular architecture for easily integrating new cryptographic algorithms and key management systems.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable secure and private data sharing between parties without revealing sensitive information.
- Integrates hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and cryptographic operations, adhering to FIPS 140-2 standards.
- Supports multi-signature schemes with customizable threshold policies for enhanced security and decentralized control over token transactions.
- Provides a RESTful API for seamless integration with external applications and services, including detailed error handling and rate limiting.
- Implements a robust auditing system that logs all cryptographic operations and access attempts for compliance and security monitoring.
- Offers configurable transaction fee mechanisms, including dynamic fee estimation based on network congestion and transaction priority.
- Validates all input data against predefined schemas to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity throughout the system.
